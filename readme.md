Scuba Squirrel is a simple iOS/Android mobile game created by a group of software development students over the course of 2 weeks.

### Try the Game!
The game requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en "Node.js") to run.
It is also recommended to have a phone able to scan QR codes or to use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio "Android Studio") to create a virtual device. If you are using a physical device, install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client "Expo Go") via the AppStore/PlayStore.
We have conducted extensive testing on the Android Nexus 6P, so this would be the recommended Emulated Device at this time.

Once you have your device ready: 
- Through the terminal, navigate to the app's main folder and type `npm install`.
- Once all necessary packages are installed, type `npm start`.
- You can scan the QR code to start on your physical phone or type `a` to launch through the Android Studio emulator.
- Navigate through the game (and read the tutorial!)

### Technologies
We used React Native and Typescript/JavaScript for the app basis. 
The main libraries used are the [React Native Game Engine](https://github.com/bberak/react-native-game-engine "React Native Game Engine") and [Matter.js](https://brm.io/matter-js/ "Matter.js") for the Game Engine and Game Loop, and the Physics engine respectively.
We are navigating throught he app with the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/ "React Navigation") library.
