### Deep Sea

Android/iOS game with React Native Game Engine.
You are a diver, exploring oceans, looking to reach ever deeper. However, the sea is uncaring, and it is on you to manage you descent. If you don't, you might not make it back up...

### MVP

- Display a diver and be able to move them up/down and stop in the ocean. 
- Display diver's current depth.
- The diver has an oxygen allowance that diminishes with time and a pressure threshold that increases while moving and descreases while standing still.
- Running out of oxygen or reaching the pressure threshold leads to game over.
- Reaching the surface wins the game.
- There is an ocanic backdrop with passing fish, lighting changes with increasing depths.

### Extensions

- Diver can be moved with a swipe on the phone. Speed of the swipe affect speed of movement.
- Dangerous fishes/sharks roam the depth and collision creates game over condition.
- Game stores and display 3 deepest points reached.
- Occasional rock formations diver can mine (button mash) to partially replenish oxygen.
- Lower depths increase frequency of dangerous fishes.
- Vertical speed affects increase of pressure gauge.
- Speed affects exertion and oxygen consumption rate.
- Maximum depth to Cthulhu/Atlantis?
- Deploy game on App/iOS store (either/or/and).
